# NYCHA XRF Lead Testing

NYCHA has a [dashboard](https://my.nycha.info/PublicSite/Transparency/XrfReport) that can generate development level results of their lead based paint testing initiative. It currently isn't available for download anywhere so I built this scraper to get the results and export them to a csv.
